# PyBear Analysis By City Types

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to asses key factors related to PyBer's performance across the three types of cities: Rural, Suburban, and Urban as well as to visualize the weekly fare generation from January 2019 through April 2019 for those city types. The key factors measured included: the total numbers of drivers, fares, and averages of fares amount per ride and fare amount per driver.

# Results

## Analysis By City Type
Analysis of the PyBer data set by city types showed that overall, urban areas produced significantly greater numbers across the board. In regards to populations of drivers, the urban cities had an 86.7% majority (2405 drivers) versus 12.5% (490 drivers) for suburban cities or 0.8%(78 drivers) for rural cities. Total Fares showed 62.7% of revenue ($39,854.38) coming from urban environments as compared to 30.5% ($19,356.33) from suburban cities and 6.8% ($4,327.93) from rural cities. It only makes sense then that the urban cities dominated the number of rides provided as well, with urban cities totaling 68.4% of rides over 26.3% of rides for suburban cities and 5.3% of rides for rural cities. When assessing the Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver however, we do see an inversion in this pattern. With fares per ride, we see rural tops the list with a $34.62 average over $30.97 suburban average and a $24.53 urban average. Drivers in the rural cities will earn an average $55.49 over the suburban driver's $39.50 or the urban driver's $16.57. This makes sense considering that rural areas are spaced out much larger than suburban or urban areas and as such, the durations and fares of rides will increase and the fare per driver will then increase. This does not give an indication that the higher fare per ride or higher fare per driver creates greater revenues when considering the much higher frequency of rides in the urban enviroments. This can be seen by the total revenue generated by urban cities in Fig5.

## Analysis Of Fares Over Time
In this analysis, we see the performance of each city type in revenue generation from January 2019 thorugh April 2019. It is clearly visible that urban environments hold the best potential for high earnings vs suburban or rural. We can also see that there are spikes in revenue near the end of February across all city types with urban cities seeing a second spike in the beingging of March. It can also be seen that the beginning of the year has lower revenue generation for urban and suburban with the lowest fare totals being about January 1st. This raises questions though becuase January 1st is a holiday where many people use ride-sharing to make it home safely from parties and a spike should be seen at that time not a drop.

# Summary
This data set and analysis shows confirms already standing expectations pertaining to revenue generating capacities of different city types based on population density and distances between origins and destinations. Given the information at hand we can make a few recommendations. First, while rural areas demand higher fares per trip, they produce a much smaller volume of rides. If it were possible to increase the volume of rides in rural cities, perhaps by creating incentives for rural drivers, revenue would increase as well. Second, while urban cities have higher populations and thus a higher volume of people, many people live in suburbs and travel into and out of cities regularly. We see solid performance from the suburban cities, but may be able to capture more of the market of suburabn to ubran travel if we incentivize drivers to make those routes. Finally, incentivizing drivers to be available on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day would likekly help increase the revenue generation on the first of January when the demand for PyBer's services are likely in higher demand. It may also be good to review te sources of this data and confirm that no errors were made in the collection and aggregation.
